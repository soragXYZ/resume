# ðŸŒ€ Testnets, nodes and validators

I like to contribute to emerging projects. I have been running nodes and validators for a lot of projects, mainly in incentivised testnets. It helps to decentralize and secure the network. I run them on VPSs.

## Basic

* Starknet
* Sui
* Ternoa
* Dymension

## Incentivised

* Aptos (validator)
* Celestia (lightnode)
* OKP4 (validator)
