# â›“ Web3 Testnets and Protocols

## Testnet

I like to contribute to emerging projects. I have been running nodes or validators for a lot of projects, mainly in incentivised testnets

### Basic

* Starknet
* Sui
* Ternoa
* Dymension

### Incentivised

* Aptos (validator)
* Celestia (lightnode)
* OKP4 (validator)

## Protocols

* AAVE for AMM
* ENS, because 0x addresses are not human friendly
* Lenster
* Hop Exchange for bridging assets
* Kleros for decentralized justice
* and so on... check my ENS!

## Luchadores

Luchadores.io is a 100% on-chain auto battler NFT project. Luchadores are designed to exist forever on the Ethereum blockchain with 100% onchain art + metadata, unlike many projects whose data is store on centralised servers.

This is where my profile picture comes from ! I own the [Luchador 2998](https://luchadores.io/luchador/2998).
