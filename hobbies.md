## Home automation

Another thing I like to do is to automate my house. I have multiple smart plugs, sensors, light bulbs... working with [Zigbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee) protocol. All data is gathered by [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), running on a NUC. From here I can monitor the power consumption of each plug, create scenarios and so on.
