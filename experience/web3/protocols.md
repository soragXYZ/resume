# ðŸ”§ Protocols

## :ghost: AAVE

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

ENSâ€™s job is to map human-readable names like â€˜alice.ethâ€™ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports â€˜reverse resolutionâ€™, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

## ðŸŒ¿ Lenster

Lenster is a decentralized, and permissionless social media app built with Lens Protocol. Lens Protocol is a composable and decentralized social graph. With Lens Protocol, you are in control. You own your profile, where you use it, how you use it, and even how you monetize it. That means you have the power over your content, and itâ€™s all right there, as an NFT, in your wallet. Itâ€™s not just easy. Itâ€™s how digital identity should be : yours.

## :scales: Kleros

Kleros is a decentralized application built on top of Ethereum that works as a decentralized third party to arbitrate disputes in every kind of contract, from very simple to highly complex ones. It relies on game theoretic incentives to have jurors rule cases correctly. The result is a dispute resolution system that renders ultimate judgments in a fast, inexpensive, reliable and decentralized way.

## :detective: Proof of Humanity

Proof of Humanity is a system combining social verification with video submission in order to create a Sybil-proof list of humans. It is meant to be used by individuals as a point-of-entry to a myriad of new use cases that require users to prove they are real humans and not duplicate/fake/bot accounts. It will be plugged into a variety of existing and new applications in need for such identity systems.

## Jumper

It is like a bridge aggregator. The problem Jumper solves is simple. Jumper lets you swap any token on chain, using any bridge and any DEX.

## :rabbit2: Rabbithole

RabbitHole helps users navigate the play to earn space with curated opportunities. The company also allows users to build their knowledge with resources across DeFi, DAOs, and NFTs as well as explore web3 projects and earn rewards doing so.

## :potable\_water: Liquity

Liquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw interest-free loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Learn more about these mechanisms in our documentation.&#x20;

Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.

## :rocket: Rocket Pool

Rocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralised, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH development.

Rocket Pool is designed to cater to two main user groups; those that wish to participate in tokenised staking using rETH using as little as 0.01 ETH and those that wish to stake ETH and run a node in the network to help generate a higher ROI than staking outside of the protocol due to commissions earned.
