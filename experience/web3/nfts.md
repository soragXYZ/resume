# ðŸª„ NFTs

## Luchadores

Luchadores.io is a 100% on-chain auto battler NFT project. Luchadores are designed to exist forever on the Ethereum blockchain with 100% onchain art + metadata, unlike many projects whose data is store on centralised servers.

This is where my profile picture comes from ! I own the [Luchador 2998](https://luchadores.io/luchador/2998).
