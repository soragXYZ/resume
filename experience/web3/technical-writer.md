# ‚úç Technical writer

## Medium

I write technical articles on my Medium. I try to explain concepts or technical aspects with simple words, so that everyone can understand clearly.

For exemple, I wrote an article on how seeds and private keys works, and [how to protect your wallet](https://medium.com/@sorag.eth/comment-prot%C3%A9ger-son-patrimoine-crypto-78991eb6e82f).

I have also written an article (bit of maths involved here) on [how to calculate the theoretical maximum lever](https://medium.com/@sorag.eth/les-boucles-demprunt-et-d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t-bce76aaa4e0d)[age](https://medium.com/@sorag.eth/les-boucles-demprunt-et-d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t-bce76aaa4e0d) you can achieve with a lending protocol.

Last but not least, I wrote an article on [how to physically protect your seed](https://medium.com/@sorag.eth/comment-s%C3%A9curiser-physiquement-sa-seed-63e8c9218d54), using DIY methods.

## DeFi France

I am a contributor of DeFi France. DeFi France is the main French-speaking community for exchanging around decentralized finance. It is organized thanks to the contributions of its members, recognized at their fair value.
